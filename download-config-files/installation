## Mount usb stick

- Insert Stick into Raspberry Pi and put following commands into the terminal:

```
sudo mkdir /media/usb
```

with `sudo blkid -o list -w /dev/null` you can get the path, name and fs_type from your stick, it probably is `/dev/sda1`.

This path/name and fs_type you have to insert into the next command:
`sudo mount -t <fs_type> -o utf8,uid=pi,gid=pi /dev/<usb stick name> /media/usb`

```
sudo cp -r /media/usb/<yourPathOnYourStick>/newcluster/ .

sudo umount /media/usb
```

* You can unplug the usb stick now

These previous commands are mounting the usb stick and copying the files into the root of your raspberries file system.


### Remove login to make Kiosk mode possible 

```
sudo raspi-config
```

```
-> System Options -> Boot / Auto Login -> B2 Console Autologin
-> Finish -> Reboot: No
```

We use the Kiosk Mode as a super full screen mode of the frontend, which otherwise would be a normal tab in the browser. 
The operating mode is more difficult to exit than regular full screen mode and protects against setting changes.
Notice, that it also works on raspbian lite as a normal (but only) user interface.

Since you still need a password if you change to the terminal, changing the password is still an important thing to do.


## Run installation script

The installations scripts come with the system and automatically install and set up the database, the frontend, the backend
and the Kiosk Mode.

```
cd newcluster
sudo chmod +x ./preinstallation.sh
sudo ./preinstallation.sh
```
On this point, the raspberry will automatically do a reboot to make some changes effective.

---
 
After the reboot put the following commands
- Instead of `your_username` and `your_password` think of a secure password.  
*Important*: Note it somewhere since you'll need it if you want to add more doors later. Also, you should mark your first raspberry somehow,
because you need to know which one was the very first when adding more doors.


```
cd newcluster
sudo chmod +x ./setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh your_username your_password
```
